## TaskQuest

**TaskQuest** is an engaging, fun and easy-to-use to-do list application for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Developed by Shayn Adatia, Matthew Switt, Andrei Gliga and William Wang (Team 102).

We are planning to meet 2-3 times weekly, following a hybrid model. Meeting minutes are tracked [here](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/s4adatia/cs-346-project/-/wikis/Meeting-Minutes).

## Description

TaskQuest is a task tracking app with a focus on engaging users and motivating them to complete their tasks. We have found that while many apps exist for efficiently organizing, tracking and displaying your tasks, most of them do not help with motivating users to accomplish their tasks, especially for individuals who have difficulty focusing and prioritizing their duties.

Our application includes several gamification features for promoting the completion of tasks. Users earn virtual currency, which we call TaskCoins, for every task that they complete. More difficult and higher priority tasks award more TaskCoins, and this is to encourage the prompt completion of high priority tasks, as well as provide a sense of pride and accomplishment for completing difficult ones. TaskCoins can be used within our shop to unlock new cosmetic features, such as profile pictures.

TaskQuest offers users 3 modes of interaction. Firstly, we offer a simple, easy-to-use user interface via our desktop application for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Secondly, we offer a lightweight and compact command line interface, available through npm. Lastly, we also offer a tray icon for Windows and MacOS, which allows users to create new tasks on the fly without having to open up the entire application.

TaskQuest also includes a variety of quality-of-life features for users, including saving data both to the cloud as well as locally, hotkeys and shortcuts for every command, grouping of tasks via lists and tags, and many more! We hope you enjoy using TaskQuest!
